# AltCheckBot
Reddit bot used to identify if someone might be using an alternate account

## Instructions for using the bot within reddit:
Reply !altcheck to the comment of a user you suspect to be an alternate account of the original thread's author.

Or

I will then reply to you with the following information:

-The total amount of comments posted by the alt in posts created by the main account
-The amount of replies made by the alt account to the main account's comments
-The amount of replies made by the alt account to the main account's comments in the main account's threads
-The average time after creation of the main account's posts that it takes the alt to comment
-The amount of comments posted by the alt in the main account's thread within 15 minutes of the post being created

**Deleting replies:**

If required, downvote the bot and it will delete its comment after -1 votes
